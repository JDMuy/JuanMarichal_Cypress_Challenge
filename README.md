# Juan Marichal QA Engineer Coding Challenge

Welcome to my coding challenge! This project demonstrates a basic Cypress test suite for a simple login process and form filling on a web application.
Note: This is a basic test suite that demostrates my knowledge about this test framework. And how I used to structure my specs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Cypress tests on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node.js package manager)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (Latest preferred)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JDMuy/JuanMarichal_Cypress_Challenge.git

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencias

    ```bash
   npm install

### How to run the specs

- Headless mode:
 ```bash
   npx cypress run
```
